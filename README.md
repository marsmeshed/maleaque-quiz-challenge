# maleaque-quiz-challenge


## Description
 The motivation behind this project was to not only assist myself and others who are in need of a short quiz, but to display my skills in JS.
 I built this project mainly to showcase my programming using Javascript. This short program will solve issues regarding certain questions. You'll never need to sit and brainstorm for these select answers, it's now easier than ever. I learned many elements of JS throughout this project including: null and its cause.

## Usage
Here's a screenshot showing a mockup of what should appear when loading up the program.
